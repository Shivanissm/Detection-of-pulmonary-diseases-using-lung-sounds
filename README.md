# Detection-of-pulmonary-diseases-using-lung-sounds

Respiratory diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early and accessible diagnosis of these can save many lives. With this project, we intend to develop a non-invasive technique to detect pulmonary diseases like asthma, bronchitis, and COPD.This will be done by detecting acoustic patterns like crackles, rhonchi, and wheezes related to underlying respiratory diseases using MFCCs and CNNs.
